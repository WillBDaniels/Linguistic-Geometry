The grammar derivation of zones for this table looks like the following: 

$$u = (14, 39, 3), l = l_0 = 3 \text{ Because } Q_1(u)=(ON(BISHOP) = 14) \wedge (MAP_{h5, BISHOP}(39) \leq 3 \ leq 3) \wedge ((ON(PAWN)  = 39) \wedge (OPPOSE(BISHOP, PAWN))) = T$$
$$S(u, zero, zero) Q1\rightarrow A(u, zero, zero)$$
$$A(u, zero, zero) Q2_{i = 1} \rightarrow t(h_i^0(u), 4) A((0,0,0), g(h_1^0(u), zero), zero)$$
Computation of $h_i^0(u) (l = 3)$
$$\text{TRACKS}_{\text{BISHOP}} = \{\text{BISHOP}\}  \text{X}  \cup L \left[ G_t^{(2)}(h5, h1, k, \text{BISHOP})\right]$$
The trajectory requested in the problem is the trajectory: 
$$T_B = a(g3), a(f4), a(e5)$$
Thus TRACKS = $\{(\text{BISHOP}, t_B)\}$, the number of trajectories $b = 1$\\
and $h_1^0(u) = (BISHOP, t_B) t(BISHOP, t_B, 5)$
Computation of $g(h_1^0(u), zero)$
$$g(h_1^0(u), zero) = g(BISHOP, t_B, zero)$$
$$g_r\left (\text{BISHOP}, t_B, zero\right ) = \left \{ \frac{1,  if  \text{ DIST}(r text{if BISHOP}, t_B) < 2n}{0,   \text{if DIST}\left (r, \text{BISHOP}, t_B \right ) = 2n}\right \}$$
$$DIST (x, BISHOP, t_B) = k +1$$
where $k$ is the number of symbols of the trajectory $t_B$, whose parameter value is equal to $x$
$$DIST(g3, BISHOP, t_B) = 2$$
$$DIST(f4, BISHOP, t_B) = 3$$
$$DIST(e5, BISHOP, t_B) = 4$$
For the rest of $x$ from $X DIST (x, BISHOP, T_B) = 2 X 64 = 128$
For $r \in \{e5, f4, g3\} = \{39, 30, 23\} g_r(BISHOP, t_B, zero) = 1$, for the rest of $r g_r = 0$
$$A(u, zero, zero) \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4)$$
$$A((0, 0, 0), g(BISHOP, t_B, zero), zero)$$
$$TIME(z) = DIST(z, BISHOP, t_B)$$
$TIME(z)$ is equal to 128 for all $z \in X$ except $\{e5, f4, g3\}$, where $TIME(z)$ is equal to $4, 3, 2$ respectively
$$Q3 ((0, 0, 0)) = (0 \not = 64) \wedge (0 \not = 64)$$
$$t(BISHOP, t_1, 4) A((0, 0, 0), v, zero) Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_1, 4) A( f((0, 0, 0), v), v, zero)$$
computation of f
$$u = (x, y, l) = (0, 0, 0) \text{ and } v_{y+1} = v_1 = 0: f(u, v) = (1, y+1, TIME(y+1) X v_{y+1}) = (1, 1, 0)$$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4) A((1, 1,0), v, zero) NEXTTIME(z) = init(0, 0, 0), NEXTTIME(z)) = 2n = 128 \text{ for all z from X.}$$
try $4j u = (x, y, l) = (1, 1, 0), \text{ i.e. } , l = 0 \text{ and } Q4 = F$
Try 3 $u = (x, y, l) = (1, 1, 0), v $ is in Table, and $w = zero$
$$Q3(1, 1, 0) = T$$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4) A(f((1, 1, 0), v), v, zero).$$
computation of f\\
As far as $(l = 0) \wedge (y = 1) $ and $v_{y+1} = v_2 = 0, f(u, v) = (1, y+1, TIME(y+1) X v_{y_1}) = (1, 2, 0)$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4) A((1, 2, 0), v, zero)$$
$$NEXTTIME(z) = init((1, 1, 0), NEXTTIME(z))$$
$$NEXTTIME(z) = 128 \text{ for all } z \text{ from} X$$
Try $4j Q4(1,2, 0) = F$
Try 3 $Q3(1, 2, 0) = T$
Try 4j $Q4(1, 3, 0) = F$
Loop continues until $u$ changes either way: 
$$l = TIME(y+1) X v_{y+1} \not = 0 $$ 
or 
$$y = 128$$
In our case $v_{38+1} = 1(\not = 0)$
38'th application of prouction 3 will result: 
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 5) A((1, 37, 4), v, zero)$$
because
$$u = (1, 38, 0))$$
$y+1$ corresponds to $h1, TIME(y+1) X v_{y_1} = TIME(h1) X 1 = 4$
Try 4j $Q4(1, 39, 4) = F$
Try 3 with $l > 0 $ and $x \not = 64$

This means the beginning of a new loop which consists of multiple application of production 3 after failures of attemptes to apply one of productions $4j$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4) A((2, 39, 4), v, zero)$$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4) A((3, 39, 4), v, zero)$$
$$......$$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4) A(50, 38, 4), v, zero)$$
With $u = (50, 39, 4) $ this loop will terminate because 
$$Q4(50, 39, 4) = (ON(KING) = 50) \wedge (4 > 0) \wedge (\phi (BISHOP, KING) = 0) \wedge (MAP_{b7, KING}(e5) = 4) = T$$
which means that productions $4j$ are applicable. 
These productions will generate intercepting trajectories from $b7$ to $e5$
$$4j \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_b, 4) t(h_j(50, 39, 4) , TIME(39)) A((50, 39, 4), v, g(h_j(50, 39, 4), zero))$$
$$4j \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4) t(h_j(50, 39, 4), TIME(8)) A((50, 39, 4), v, g(h_j(50, 39, 4), ero))$$
Computation of $h_j(50, 39, 4)$
We have to generate all the shortest trajectories from point $b7$ to $e5$ for the black KING. The length of these trajectories should be less or equal to 4
$$TRACKS_{KING} = \left \{KING\right \} X \cup L \left [ G_t^{(2)}(b7, e5, k, KING)\right ]$$
$$TRACKS = \left \{ (KING, t_1), (KING, t_2)\right \}, m = 2$$
and 
$$h_1(50, 39, 4) = (KING, t_1)$$
$$h_2(50, 39, 4)  =(KING, t_2)$$
There are two such trajectories $t1, t2$ and they are generated by the grammar $G_t^{(2)}$ 
Taking into account that $TIME(39) = 4$ we have: 
$$4_1 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4)t((KING, t_K), 4) A((50, 39, 4), v, g(KING, t_K, zero))$$
$$4_1 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4)t((KING, t_K), 4) A((50, 39, 4), v, g(KING, t_K, zero))$$
For all $r \in X$ the r-th component of functiong $g $ is as follows: 
$$g_r\left (\text{KING}, t_K, zero\right ) = \left \{ \frac{1,  if  \text{ DIST}(r text{if KING}, t_K) < 2n}{0,   \text{if DIST}\left (r, \text{KING}, t_K \right ) = 2n}\right \}$$
$$DIST (x, KING, t_K) = k +1$$
where $k$ is the number of symbols of the trajectory $t_B$, whose parameter value is equal to $x$
$$DIST(c6, KING, t_K) = 2$$
$$DIST(d5, KING, t_K) = 3$$
$$DIST(e5, KING, t_K) = 4$$
For the rest of $x$ from $X DIST (x, KING, T_K) = 2 X 64 = 128$
For $r \in \{e5, d5, c6\} = \{39, 37, 43\} g_r(KING, t_K, zero) = 1$, for the rest of $r g_r = 0$
Computation of NEXTTIME 
$$NEXTTIME(z) = ALPHA(z, (KING, t_K), 4- 4+1)$$
From previous steps $NEXTTIME(x) = 128$ for all $x$ from $X$
 \begin{displaymath}
   ALPHA (x, p_0, t_0, k)  = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       max &  (NEXTTIME (x), k), \ if \ (DIST(x, p_0, t_0) \not = 2n)\\
	& \wedge (NEXTTIME (x) \not = 2n); \\
       k, &  \ if \ DIST (x, p_0, t_0) \not = 2n) \\
	& \wedge (NEXTTIME (x) = 2n); \\
       NEXTTIME(x) & \ if \ DIST(x, p_0, t_0) = 2n).\\
     \end{array}
   \right.
\end{displaymath}
Try 3 with $u = (50, 39, 4)$, i.e. with $l > 0$ and $x \not = 64$
New lop consists of multiple application of production 3 after failures of attemptes to apply one of productions $4j$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4)t(KING, t_F, 4) A((50, 39, 4), v, w)$$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4)t(KING, t_F, 4) A((51, 39, 4), v, w)$$
$$......$$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4)t(KING, t_F, 4) A(64, 38, 4), v, w)$$
With $u = (64, 39, 4) $ this loop will terminate which means no other starting poitns are found. 
New loop begins. The grammar changes ending point of prospective trajectories 
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4)t(KING, t_F, 4) A((50, 40, 0), v, w)$$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4)t(KING, t_F, 4) A((50, 41, 0), v, w)$$
$$......$$
$$Q3 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4)t(KING, t_F, 4) A(50, 64, 0), v, w)$$
It is determined that there are no more valid ending points, and thus the loop terminates. 
Try 5: $Q5(w) = (w \not = 0 ) = T$
$$Q5 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4) t(KING, t_K, 4)A((0, 0, 0), w, zero)$$
$$TIME(Z) = NEXTTIME(z)$$
All the steps, 3 and 4j, which have been executed (or tried) for generating 1-st negation trajectroeis will be repeated for generated 2-nd negation, same as the 1-st, none will be generated. The next return to produciton 5 will happen with $w = zero$ (nothing is found) that means we move to production 6: 
$$Q6 \rightarrow t(BISHOP, t_B, 4)t(King, t_K, 4)$$
 And we are done. Whew.
