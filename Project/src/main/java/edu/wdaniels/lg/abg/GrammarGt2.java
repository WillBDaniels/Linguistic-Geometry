/**
 * This class is the instantiation of the grammar of shortest admissable
 * trajectories of degree 2 Specifically, this grammar takes in a starting
 * location, and then produces a 'bundle' of trajectories from which someone
 * could then display the trajectories. In specific, a trajectory bundle is made
 * up of 'trajectories', which in turn are made up of 'points'. Each point
 * should correspond to a discretized point in space.
