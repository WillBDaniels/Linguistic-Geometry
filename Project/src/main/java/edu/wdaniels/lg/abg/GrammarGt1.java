/**
 * This class is the instantiation of the grammar of shortest trajectories. This
 * grammar takes in a starting location, and then produces a 'bundle' of
 * trajectories from which someone could then display the trajectories. In
 * specific, a trajectory bundle is made up of 'trajectories', which in turn are
 * made up of 'points'. Each point should correspond to a discretized point in
 * space.
